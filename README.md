# Jb-Sbvtle

A clean Jekyll-Bootstrap theme inspired by [svbtle](http://svbtle.com/). Most of the codes are ported from [wp-svbtle](https://github.com/gravityonmars/wp-svbtle).

Jekyll-Bootstrap is really an awsome way to start and publish your jekyll powered blog, see: <https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap>

You can take a quick look at this demo: <http://blog.kevinlife.org>


## INSTALL

Just run this under your blog folder:

    rake theme:install git="https://github.com/jekyllbootstrap/theme-twitter.git"

If using `md` index then remove it. This theme uses an html index. You need to specify posts per page in order for the
index to display listing of posts. Smth like :

```
paginate: 3
```

in `_config.yml`
